                This website represents an improved consolidation of community-wide standards and their implementation
                as part of the Linked Open Data eco-system. It comprises of the two main elements: controlled
                vocabularies and ontology. You can currently access and test the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5501/type_of_inscription/#vocabularies" target="_blank">first stage</a> of the development of
                controlled vocabularies! The updated epigraphic ontology is under development and will be released here
                in late 2024.

                <p class="mt-2">
                    Controlled vocabularies provide a consistent and objective way to describe data and define their
                    exact meaning across projects and disciplines. They represent standardised and organised terms,
                    often as an alphabetical list with a hierarchical structure of broader and narrower terms, their
                    definitions and alternative labels in multiple languages. In the world of Linked Open Data, the
                    controlled vocabulary represents a piece of authoritative information for researchers but also for
                    project administrators, a unique and stable reference that describes a concept or a phenomenon that
                    is being recorded.

                    The creation of an updated controlled epigraphic vocabulary has been identified by the community as
                    essential to moving forward towards the best practice of FAIR and Open Science in epigraphy (Tupman

                    proposed FAIR epigraphic controlled vocabularies present a consolidation of work conducted by the
                    EAGLE Europeana Project in 2013-2016 (Liuzzo et al. 2013; Liuzzo 2015; Liuzzo and Evangelisti 2021)

                <p class="mt-2">
                    The FAIR Epigraphic Vocabularies represent a ‘bottom-up’ application that employs a multifaceted
                    hierarchic categorisation system allowing for multiple conceptual approaches while recognizing the
                    complex and multilingual nature of inscriptions and the discipline's historiography. Furthermore,
                    the vocabulary adheres to the principles of FAIR data, emphasizing Findability, Accessibility,
                    Interoperability, and Reusability as their core principles (Wilkinson et al. 2016). This means that
                    researchers can easily locate and access relevant terms, ensuring that the vocabulary is
                    user-friendly and widely applicable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The controlled vocabulary is made available as a Linked Open Data (LOD) resource, accessible online
                    with stable Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), hosted by the FAIR Epigraphy Project and the
                    University of Oxford. This approach facilitates efficient collaboration, linking, and
                    cross-referencing, enabling researchers to build upon each other's work and explore epigraphy in a
                    structured and accessible manner across project boundaries. Overall, this initiative enhances the
                    research landscape in epigraphy by fostering cooperation and providing a reliable and standardised
                    resource for scholars in the field.

                <p class="mt-2">
                    The vocabularies that are currently in use by the majority of digital projects were created in
                    2013-2016 as a result of the EAGLE Europeana Project (Liuzzo et al. 2013; Liuzzo 2015; Liuzzo and
                    Evangelisti 2021). The project created a digital list of several hundreds of vocabularies as they
                    were used in several partner projects. The vocabularies are divided into seven categories, with
                    three of them being unique to epigraphy and four of them being shared with other disciplines:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        epigraphy specific
                        <ul>
                            <li>type of inscription/function</li>
                            <li>object type</li>
                            <li>execution technique</li>

                    </li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        shared with other disciplines
                        <ul>
                            <li>material</li>
                            <li>decoration</li>

                    </li>
                </ul>

                Each vocabulary was published online with its own stable URI and short description. Some of them also
                have their equivalents in other languages and links to example inscriptions.

                    Why do we need a new vocabulary?
                </i>
                <p class="mt-2">
                    During the Epigraphy.info meetings, the community concluded that the EAGLE vocabularies in their
                    current state are not satisfactory enough for the community to move towards LOD. During the online
                    meeting in 2020, the working group tasked to improve the EAGLE vocabularies was revived. The working
                    group decided to investigate first the ‘type of inscription’ category, assuming it would be the
                    easiest one to start as it represents the core of the discipline. On the contrary, it proved to be
                    one of the most difficult ones, as due to different traditions, there is no universal consensus and
                    almost every project tends to approach types of inscriptions differently. Subsequently, the group
                    identified the EAGLE vocabularies suffer from the following issues:

                <ul>
                    <li>the current vocabularies miss any hierarchic structure,</li>
                    <li>they contain many duplicates across the various language versions as a result of a merge of
                        vocabularies from multiple projects without aligning their terms,</li>
                    <li>they do not contain explicit and clear explanations with multiple illustrative examples,</li>
                    <li>the type of inscription vocabularies contains a mixture of two systems of categorisation: type
                        of text, or rather its function, and type of inscribed monument, e.g. mosaic, graffiti, or the
                        very problematic instrumentum domesticum,
                    </li>
                    <li>the current user interface is not easily searchable and accessible to people without an IT
                        background, as there is no clear distinction between preferred terms and similar ones</li>
                </ul>

                The working group suggested conceptual outlines for the new system while maintaining the language
                diversity of vocabularies. Yet the mixing of text and object categories, duplication and missing
                hierarchy were identified as serious threats to the implementation of Linked Open Data principles. The
                discussions of the working group in 2020 and 2021 were then used as a starting point for the FAIR
                Epigraphy project to develop the conceptual outline into a FAIR Epigraphic vocabularies, a LOD online
                resource available to the entire community.

                    in the field. This FAIR Epigraphic vocabulary is designed with a hierarchical structure, allowing
                    for the organization of terms and concepts logically. Additionally, it employs a multimodal and
                    multifaceted categorization system, allowing for multiple ways of categorization, and recognizing
                    the complex nature of inscriptions and their historiography. The vocabulary accommodates not only

                    To ensure the completeness and coherence of our controlled vocabulary for epigraphy, we addressed
                    the issue of missing terms and concepts. When we identified relevant concepts that were absent from

                    In developing our controlled vocabulary for epigraphy, we made deliberate choices to ensure its
                    usability and comprehensiveness. English was selected as the primary documentation language, which
                    not only reflects your multilingual approach but also enhances accessibility for a broader academic
                    audience. To enrich the vocabulary's utility, we provided detailed metadata for each term, including
                    source information, creation date (where available), and relevant project references. This
                    additional context allows users to trace the origin and historical development of terms, ensuring

                    In line with the commitment to clarity, we included clear and concise definitions for each term.
                    Recognizing that many projects lack their definitions, we extensively consulted main reference books
                    in various languages to compile authoritative and contextually accurate definitions. Surprisingly,
                    none of the general reference books of Latin or Greek epigraphy provided us with helpful definitions
                    of the epigraphic type. Thus we needed to create our own definitions to become a core part of the
                    new FAIR vocabulary.
